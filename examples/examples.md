## üîπ Example 1: Basic Lattice gender-age example

|        | Female | Juvenile | Adult | Male |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|------|
| Girl   | x      | x        |        |      |
| Woman  | x      |          | x      |      |
| Boy    |        | x        |        | x    |
| Man    |        |          | x      | x    |

Below are two concept lattices derived from the same formal context. The left shows full labeling, and the right shows reduced labeling.

The following visualizations are based on a formal context of building regulations. On the left, we see the default concept lattice. On the right, the filtering feature is demonstrated for the object **¬ß15** and the attribute **roof**, highlighting relevant concepts. A tooltip is also shown for demonstration purposes.

In this view, nodes are color-coded based on filtering results:
- üü† **Orange**: match in both extent and intent  
- üü¢ **Green**: match in extent only  
- ‚ö´ **Grey**: match in intent only

## üîπ Example 3: Life in Water

The following formal context relates to biological traits of animals and plants, including movement, habitat, and reproduction.

Below is the concept lattice computed from the formal context above. A single tooltip is shown for demonstration purposes.
In this view, the selected node and the connected edges are colored red.

## üîπ Example 4: Parsed JSON Example from `concepts` Library

This example is taken directly from the [concepts Python library documentation](https://concepts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#example-json), demonstrating a formal context for linguistic agreement features (person, number, polarity).

The following table shows the original binary relation between personal pronouns and their grammatical features:

|      | +1 | -1 | +2 | -2 | +3 | -3 | +sg | +pl | -sg | -pl |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1sg  | x  |    |    |    |    | x   | x   |     | x   |     |
| 1pl  | x  |    |    |    |    | x   |     | x   |     | x   |
| 2sg  |    | x  | x  |    |    |     | x   |     | x   |     |
| 2pl  |    | x  | x  |    |    |     |     | x   |     | x   |
| 3sg  |    |    |    | x  | x  |     | x   |     | x   |     |
| 3pl  |    |    |    | x  | x  |     |     | x   |     | x   |

The following concept lattice was automatically generated using our `lattice.js` parser, successfully converting the original `concepts` JSON format into our internal structure:

‚úÖ This confirms compatibility between `lattice.js` and external FCA tools like the `concepts` Python library.

## üîπ Example 5: ü¶ì Zoo Dataset: Large Concept Lattice

This example uses the [UCI Zoo dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/111/zoo), which contains binary attributes for 80 animal species. The formal context was constructed by converting these attributes into a cross-table suitable for Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).

The generated concept lattice demonstrates the ability of `lattice.js` to handle large structures with multiple overlapping layers and a high density of concepts.

üìä **Dataset Statistics**
- **Total Concepts**: 214
- **Total Objects**: 80
- **Total Attributes**: 15

üì∑ **Visualization**

<div align="center">
  <img src="./screenshots/zoo-80x15.png" alt="Zoo concept lattice" width="850"/>
</div>

This example highlights the need for advanced features like reduced labeling, edge bundling, and zoom controls when visualizing dense lattices. It also shows that `lattice.js` remains responsive and readable even when scaled to over 200 concepts.
