# üõ†Ô∏è**Examples**

This page showcases a set of example visualizations and use cases using `lattice.js`. These examples demonstrate different labeling modes, filtering, and layout strategies supported by the library.

## üîπ Example 1: Basic Lattice gender-age example

|        | Female | Juvenile | Adult | Male |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|------|
| Girl   | x      | x        |        |      |
| Woman  | x      |          | x      |      |
| Boy    |        | x        |        | x    |
| Man    |        |          | x      | x    |

Below are two concept lattices derived from the same formal context. The left shows full labeling, and the right shows reduced labeling.

The following visualizations are based on a formal context of building regulations. On the left, we see the default concept lattice. On the right, the filtering feature is demonstrated for the object **¬ß15** and the attribute **roof**, highlighting relevant concepts. A tooltip is also shown for demonstration purposes.

In this view, nodes are color-coded based on filtering results:
- üü† **Orange**: match in both extent and intent  
- üü¢ **Green**: match in extent only  
- ‚ö´ **Grey**: match in intent only

## üîπ Example 3: Life in Water

The following formal context relates to biological traits of animals and plants, including movement, habitat, and reproduction.

Below is the concept lattice computed from the formal context above. A single tooltip is shown for demonstration purposes.
In this view, nodes are color-coded based on filtering results:
- üîµ **Blue**: concept does not match either filter criterion 
- üü¢ **Green**: match in extent only  
- ‚ö´ **Grey**: match in intent only

## üîπ Example 4: Life in Water Parsed JSON Example from `concepts` Library

This example is taken directly from the [concepts Python library documentation](https://concepts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#example-json), demonstrating a formal context for linguistic agreement features (person, number, polarity).

The following table shows the original binary relation between personal pronouns and their grammatical features:

|      | +1 | -1 | +2 | -2 | +3 | -3 | +sg | +pl | -sg | -pl |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1sg  | x  |    |    |    |    | x   | x   |     | x   |     |
| 1pl  | x  |    |    |    |    | x   |     | x   |     | x   |
| 2sg  |    | x  | x  |    |    |     | x   |     | x   |     |
| 2pl  |    | x  | x  |    |    |     |     | x   |     | x   |
| 3sg  |    |    |    | x  | x  |     | x   |     | x   |     |
| 3pl  |    |    |    | x  | x  |     |     | x   |     | x   |

The following concept lattice was automatically generated using our `lattice.js` parser, successfully converting the original `concepts` JSON format into our internal structure:

‚úÖ This confirms compatibility between `lattice.js` and external FCA tools like the `concepts` Python library.
