# lattice
`lattice.js` is a lightweight and flexible JavaScript library for creating, visualizing, interactiong with, and exporting concept lattices based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), powered by D3.js. Designed for academic and research purposes, this library enables users to generate, render, and explore concept lattices in a 2D space.

## üöÄ Features and Current Status üöß

The library is **not feature-complete** and may have bugs or lack certain functionalities.

### Current Features:
- **Graph Rendering**: Automatically renders nodes, links, and labels based on input data.
- **Interactivity**: Includes drag-and-drop for nodes and zoom/pan functionality for the graph.
- **Constrained Node Movement**: Nodes can move freely horizontally but are constrained vertically, ensuring they do not overstep the upper or lower boundaries.
- **Labeling Options**: Supports three labeling modes‚ÄîID-only (default), full labeling (showing extent and intent), and reduced labeling (minimal non-redundant labels).
- **Filtering Support**: Enables user-defined filtering by extent or intent, with color-coded feedback for matched concepts.
- **Export Options**: Supports exporting the lattice as JSON, CSV, PNG, PDF, and SLF formats.
- **Data Conversion**: Includes compatibility with the Python concepts library to convert concept lattice data into a format usable by `lattice.js`.
- **Custom Layouts**: Supports customizable layouts, such as hierarchical structures.
- **Scalability**: Built with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend for future needs.
- **Academic Focus**: Includes tools for dataset handling,  export features, and FCA-specific interactions.

## üß™ Testing

You can test the library by running the provided examples locally.

1. Start a local development server:
   - If not already installed, install a lightweight server:
     ```bash
     npm install -g live-server
     ```
   - Navigate to the `examples` directory and run:
     ```bash
     live-server examples/frontpage
     ```
     OR
     Serve the project from the root directory by:
      ```bash
     live-server 
     ```

2. Open your browser and interact with the graph.
