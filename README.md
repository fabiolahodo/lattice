## üöÄ Features and Current Status üöß

The library is **not feature-complete** and may have bugs or missing functionalities.

### Current Features:
- **Graph Rendering**: Automatically renders nodes, links, and labels based on input data.
- **Dynamic Edge Colors**: Highlights edges connected to a selected node.
- **Interactivity**: Includes drag-and-drop for nodes and zoom/pan functionality for the graph.
- **Constrained Node Movement**: Nodes can move freely horizontally but are constrained vertically, ensuring they do not overstep the upper or lower boundaries.
- **Custom Layouts**: Supports customizable layouts, such as hierarchical structures.
- **Scalability**: Built with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend for future needs.
- **Academic Focus**: Includes tools for dataset handling, graph exporting, and more.
